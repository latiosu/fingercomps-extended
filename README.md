# FingerComps Extended

**FingerComps Extended** is a fan-made web application that lets climbing competitors see each others scores more deeply. The site is live at: [https://latiosu.github.io/fingercomps-extended](https://latiosu.github.io/fingercomps-extended)

I built this app to complement the amazing [FingerComps](https://fingercomps.com/) product and enable learning and growth for all fellow competition climbers.
