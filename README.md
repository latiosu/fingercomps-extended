# FingerComps+

**FingerComps+** is a fan-made web application that lets climbing competitors see each others scores more deeply. The site is live at: [https://fingercomps.plus](https://fingercomps.plus)

I built this app to complement the amazing [FingerComps](https://fingercomps.com/) product and enable learning and growth for all fellow competition climbers.
